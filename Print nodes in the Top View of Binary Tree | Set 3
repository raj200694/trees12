Print nodes in the Top View of Binary Tree | Set 3
Top view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the top. Given a binary tree, print the top view of it. The output nodes can be printed in any order. Expected time complexity is O(n)

A node x is there in output if x is the topmost node at its horizontal distance. Horizontal distance of left child of a node x is equal to horizontal distance of x minus 1, and that of right child is horizontal distance of x plus 1.
Example :

       1
    /     \
   2       3
  /  \    / \
 4    5  6   7
Top view of the above binary tree is
4 2 1 3 7

Top view of the above binary tree is

Approach:

The idea here is to observe that, if we try to see a tree from its top, then only the nodes which are at top in vertical order will be seen.
Start BFS from root. Maintain a queue of pairs comprising of node(Node *) type and vertical distance of node from root. Also, maintain a map which should store the node at a particular vertical distance.
While processing a node, just check if any node is there in the map at that vertical distance.
If any node is there, it means the node canâ€™t be seen from top, do not consider it. Else, if there is no node at that vertical distance, store that in map and consider for top view.
Below is the implementation based on above approach:
